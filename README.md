# House Price Prediction-
This Is Machine Learning Project In Which we try to predict the Prices of Google / tesla  Stock prices on the using the Modules

# Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various property features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and location. It is a machine learning-based project designed for educational purposes to explore regression models, data preprocessing, and model evaluation techniques.

The project involves gathering house data, preprocessing the data, training machine learning models, and predicting house prices based on the input features. By working on this project, you will learn about:

<ul>
  <li>Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, encoding)</li>
  <li>Regression models (Random Forest, Linear Regression, etc.)</li>
  <li>Model evaluation metrics (MSE, RMSE, RÂ²)</li>
  <li>Visualization of data and predictions</li>
</ul>
# Objective
To predict house prices using machine learning models based on historical housing data and various features such as size, location, and amenities.
